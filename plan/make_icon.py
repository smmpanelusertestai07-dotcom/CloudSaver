"""Draws every PocketIDE icon asset from one definition.

There is one mark and one palette here, and every file below is derived from them, so the
launcher, the Play listing, the themed icon, the notification and the splash can never drift
apart the way hand-exported assets do.

The mark is a prompt chevron held between two square brackets: [ > ]. Brackets because that is
what code looks like at a glance, and a chevron because it is the glyph every terminal and every
run button in the world uses for "go". Together they are the name too -- a pocket, holding the
thing you work with.

The chevron is doing more work than it looks. The first draft used an upright caret, and at
launcher size the mark collapsed into three identical vertical bars -- unreadable, and nothing
like brackets. An angled shape in the middle breaks that rhythm, so the eye separates three
elements instead of counting stripes. The arms are short and the gaps are wide for the same
reason: at 24 px in the status bar, every gap here is one pixel, and a gap that closes is a
blob.

Geometry is defined once on a 1024 px master and scaled down, never up.

#
# The shape is defined once at whatever size is convenient; how big it is DRAWN is never
# baked in here. Every asset passes the fraction of its own box the mark should fill, because
# the right fraction is different for each one and getting that wrong is visible on a home
# screen from across a room.
#
# The three boxes an Android icon actually lives in:
#
#   108 dp   the adaptive-icon canvas. The outer 18 dp per side is bleed the launcher eats for
#            masking and parallax, so nothing may live there.
#    72 dp   what a mask actually shows. On this phone -- and most -- that mask is a circle.
#    66 dp   the safe circle: guaranteed visible under every OEM mask shape there is.
#
# The first release drew the mark at 500 x 400 px on a 1024 master. That is a 640 px bounding
# circle inside a 626 px safe circle -- the corners were outside the safe zone, and at 73 % of
# the visible circle it read as oversized beside Gmail, Drive and Maps on the same screen.
# Those sit near 60 %, which is what MARK_FILL below now targets.

# How much of its box the mark's WIDTH takes, per asset. Each is a considered number:

#              bounding circle then lands at 512 px against a 626 px safe circle, clear of it.
#   play       0.44 of the square. A square shows more of its own area than a circle does, so
#              the same apparent weight needs a slightly larger number here.
#   legacy     0.50 of a tile that already drew its own corners -- no bleed to reserve.
#   splash     0.42. The Android 12+ splash masks the icon to a circle too.
#   notify     0.78. A status bar icon is 24 dp of which the glyph is meant to fill nearly all;
#              held to the launcher's fraction it would vanish next to the network and battery.
