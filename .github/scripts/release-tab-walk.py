"""
Opens the four tabs of the installed RELEASE build, with R8 applied.

The instrumented suite runs the debug APK, so this is the only place a
screen past launch is drawn from minified code - and a missing keep rule
shows up as a crash on the screen that needs the stripped class, not at
launch. A fresh install opens on setup, which has no tab bar, so the walk
first finishes setup the way a person would: it reads each button's label
from strings.xml and taps the button that carries it. Taps by screen
fraction used to land on setup and pass without ever reaching a tab.

Every step checks what is on screen. Never reaching the tab bar, or a tab
that does not become the selected one, fails the run instead of passing
over a screen that was never drawn.
