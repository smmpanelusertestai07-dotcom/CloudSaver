/**
 * Stops the app's own background pipeline, and waits until it has stopped.
 *
 * [Scheduler.cancelAll] is the app asking WorkManager to cancel: it hands back
 * an Operation and returns immediately, and a worker that is already running
 * keeps running until it next looks at whether it was stopped. A test that
 * seeds a gallery straight afterwards is seeding it underneath a live worker,
 * which then optimises the fixtures itself - so which file ends in which state
 * is a race between the test and the app.
 *
 * That race is what "the two optimised fixtures must be in the upload folder
 * and the other two still waiting: expected [2, 2] but was [0, 3]" was: three
 * of the four files had been through the pipeline, and only two of them by the
 * test's own hand. It reads as the app releasing files it should not have,
 * which is the most alarming thing this app could possibly do, and it is not
 * what happened.
 *
 * So: cancel, block until the cancellation has actually been applied, then
 * wait for WorkManager to report nothing running or waiting to run.
