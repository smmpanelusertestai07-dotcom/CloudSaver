/**
 * Which actions a file may be offered, decided from its state alone.
 *
 * Every list used to build its own menu, so the same file could be offered
 * "Never optimise this file" on one screen and not on another, and a file with
 * no proof could be offered "Remove from phone" simply because the screen that
 * drew it had not thought about proof. The rule now lives here: one function,
 * no UI, fully testable.
 *
 * Two principles decide everything below:
 *
 *  - **Nothing meaningless is offered.** An action that cannot do anything for
 *    this file is absent, not greyed out. A disabled control invites "why
 *    not?", and the answer belongs in the row, not in a tooltip nobody opens.
 *  - **Removing an original needs proof, always.** The check happens again at
 *    the moment of acting, but a file with no proof is never even offered it.
