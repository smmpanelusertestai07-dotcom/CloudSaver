/**
 * How much of the original survives optimising, stated as facts rather than

 *
 * "About 90-95% quality" is the kind of number an app asserts and nobody can
 * check. Everything here is either read straight off the encoder settings the
 * pipeline really uses, or is arithmetic on pixel counts - so every figure the
 * app shows can be traced back to something.
 *
 * Two separate things get called "quality", and conflating them is what makes
 * the subject confusing:
 *
 *  - **Detail kept** is resolution: what share of the original's pixels are
 *    still there. Exactly computable, and 100% for anything already under the
 *    setting's cap - which on the default setting is most photos.
 *  - **Encoder quality** is the quality factor used when re-saving. A
 *    setting, not an opinion.
