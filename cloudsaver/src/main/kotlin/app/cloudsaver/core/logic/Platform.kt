 * What this Android version can and cannot do, stated in one place.

 * The app runs on Android 10 through 16, but "runs on" is not the same as
 * "does everything on". Android 10 has no media trash, so a removed original
 * there is gone for good - and a button that says "Move to trash" while
 * permanently deleting would be the worst lie this app could tell. Every
 * screen that offers such an action asks here first, and the About page
 * states the same thing before anyone gets that far.
