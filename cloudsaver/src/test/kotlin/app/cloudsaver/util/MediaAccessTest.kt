/**
 * BB1: the access-level decision, and the places that must obey it.
 *
 * Under Android 14's "Select photos", MediaStore answers every query as if
 * the handful the user picked were the whole gallery. The app used to treat
 * that grant as usable access and present the handful as fact. The decision
 * is now a three-way level, and everything that scans, counts or projects
 * asks for the level rather than the old boolean.
