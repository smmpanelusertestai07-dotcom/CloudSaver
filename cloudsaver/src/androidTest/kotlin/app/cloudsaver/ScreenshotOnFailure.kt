/**
 * Photographs the screen the moment a test fails.
 *
 * An assertion says what it wanted and what it got. It does not say what was
 * on the screen, and the difference between those two is most of the work.
 * "Free a set amount is not displayed" was true for an hour before anyone
 * could see that the row was drawn perfectly well, just further down a list
 * the test was scrolling the wrong way; "the consent dialog never showed a
 * deny button" is still open, and the picture of that dialog is the answer.
 *
 * The shot goes where the tour's shots go - Pictures/CSTestShots, which adb
 * and CI already collect - under a name that starts with `fail-`, so the
 * failures sort together and are obvious in a folder of ordinary screens.
 * Nothing here can fail the test it is watching: the test has already
 * failed, and a broken camera must not replace the real reason with its own.
